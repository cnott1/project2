			<p>Reasons I am better at Law than Romario<br>-Presented with a tie-</p>

		<div class="txt">
			<p>I, an esteemed lawyer, have over 20 years worth of law experience. My college expelled me after 1 week because they didn't want to teach me; They thought I was
			too powerful. I sought a darker path and graduated top of my new class in just 2 weeks. In my career I have won all but one case. Though Romario
			has never beaten me in court (Though he is also the one person I can't beat). Once I even fired the judge
			to make a point and won instantly.</p>
