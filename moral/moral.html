			<p><br>My opponent is a worse overall human being than I am. He is known by names such as "El diablo" and "Diablo Rojo" in his hometown.
			I have even seen him repeatedly berate a small man once known as his "friend". He wishes only to carry these evil intentions into the National League of Master Coders.
			If he is elected there is not a chance he will support the common man. I have a dream that my children and my children's children will live in a world
			where they can be free from any form of discrimination and from Romario.
